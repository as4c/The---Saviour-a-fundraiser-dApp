# Web3 Fundraiser Project

Welcome to the Web3 Fundraiser project! This project is built using Next.js, Infura, Solidity, Hardhat, and ethers.js to create a decentralized fundraising platform where users can create campaigns, donate to campaigns, and view campaign details.

## Features

### 1. Connect Wallet
- Users can connect their Ethereum wallet to the platform using MetaMask or any other Ethereum wallet that supports Web3.

### 2. Create Campaign
- Logged-in users can create fundraising campaigns by providing necessary details such as campaign title, description, fundraising goal, etc.

### 3. Donate to Campaign
- Users can donate Ether (ETH) to the campaigns of their choice. The donated funds will be securely stored in the smart contract associated with each campaign.

### 4. See Campaign Details
- Users can view detailed information about each campaign, including the amount raised, the fundraising goal, the number of donors, and any updates provided by the campaign creator.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications.
- **Infura**: Infura provides access to Ethereum and IPFS networks, allowing developers to interact with Ethereum nodes without running their own.
- **Solidity**: Solidity is a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Hardhat**: Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum that provides built-in tasks for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts.
- **ethers.js**: ethers.js is a JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
